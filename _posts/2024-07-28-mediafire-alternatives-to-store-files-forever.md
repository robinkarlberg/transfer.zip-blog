## [transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip/): The Versatile and Secure Choice

[transfer.zip](https://transfer.zip/) stands out as a highly versatile [open source](https://github.com/robinkarlberg/transfer.zip-web/) file sharing service with a range of features to cater to different user needs. One of its most attractive aspects is the *Quick Share* feature, which allows users to share **files of unlimited size without needing to create an account**. The caveat is that these files are only available as long as the browser window remains open, making it ideal for quick and temporary transfers.

For users who prefer a more permanent solution, Transfer.zip offers the option to create an account. With an account, users can upload files up to 1GB in size, and these **files will stay available forever**. And by forever, they truly mean forever. Using the permanent transfers feature of transfer.zip is ideal for small organizations or users who want to provide files to their audience. The download pages can be customized with a title and description, enhancing trust and aligning with your organization's branding.

Security is a top priority for Transfer.zip. The "quick share" feature uses **end-to-end encryption**, ensuring that files are securely transferred and only accessible to the intended recipients, not even transfer.zip themselves can decrypt the data. When using an account, files are protected with AES-256 bit encryption, providing robust security for your permanent transfers. Additionally, the service is open source and contains limited ads, contributing to a more user-friendly experience.

- Unlimited file size
- Strong focus on privacy and encryption
- [Open source](https://github.com/robinkarlberg/transfer.zip-web/)

## [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): The Reliable Classic

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) has long been a staple in the world of file storage and sharing. Known for its reliability and ease of use, Dropbox offers a range of features that cater to both individual users and businesses. With Dropbox, you can easily upload, share, and access your files from anywhere, thanks to its comprehensive cloud-based infrastructure.

One of Dropbox's key strengths is its collaboration tools. It allows multiple users to work on the same document simultaneously, making it an excellent choice for teams and projects. Dropbox also integrates seamlessly with various third-party applications, further enhancing its functionality and versatility.

In terms of security, Dropbox employs industry-standard encryption both in transit and at rest, ensuring that your data is well protected. While it may not offer the same level of anonymity as Transfer.zip's *Quick Share* Dropbox provides a robust and dependable solution for long-term file storage and collaboration.

#### Good
- 2GB Storage with account
- Reliable and proven to work
- Mobile apps

#### Bad
- Time-consuming
- Users may find it difficult to use
- No account-free option

## [Zippyshare.day](https://zippyshare.day/): The Successor with More Options

Following the shutdown of the popular file sharing service Zippyshare, [zippyshare.day](https://zippyshare.day/) has emerged as its successor, bringing with it a new set of features and capabilities. Zippyshare.day allows users to upload **files up to 500MB without creating an account**, making it a convenient option for quick and simple file transfers, but not very large ones.

For those who need to share larger files, creating an account on Zippyshare.day increases the upload limit to 3GB. 

Zippyshare.day aims to fill the gap left by its predecessor by offering a user-friendly interface and reliable service. However, when compared to Transfer.zip's unlimited file size feature with *Quick Share*, it may seem less versatile. Nonetheless, it remains a solid choice for those who miss the simplicity and functionality of the original Zippyshare.

#### Good
- 3GB Storage with account
- Use without account
